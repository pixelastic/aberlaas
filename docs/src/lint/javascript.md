title: Lint JavaScript
---

JavaScript linting is done through [ESLint][1] and [Prettier][2].

## Configuration

If you don't like some of the linting rules, you can overwrite them in your
local `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc.js` files.

Check the default [eslint.js][3] and [prettier.js][4] configuration files to see
what rules are applied.
