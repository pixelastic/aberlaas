The `aberlaas setup` command will configure remote third party services like
[GitHub](https://github.com/) and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).

**Note that you need to have pushed your code to GitHub for this command to
work.**

You will need to have `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `CIRCLECI_TOKEN` environment variables
configured for this command to work. If you don't, the services won't be
activated, but you will be prompted with the URLs to active them manually.

Check the list below for more information on the services configured:

- [GitHub](/setup/github/)
- [CircleCI](/setup/circleci/)
- [Renovate](/setup/renovate/)
