# aberlaas

<div class="lead">Scaffold your JavaScript projects with consistent config for tests, lint, release and CI.</div>

`aberlaas` is a wrapper around Jest, ESLint, Prettier, etc and their plugins so
you only install one package in your `devDependencies` instead of dozens. 

I created this module because I got tired of copy-pasting the same configuration
files from project to project. With one _meta_ module to handle all the tooling,
I could get started on a new project in minutes instead of hours.

Using `aberlaas` on every project ensured my linting rules and release process
is consistent across my projects. Of course, if you don't like the defaults
it's shipped with, you can override them as all configuration files are exposed.

## Installation

```shell
yarn add --dev aberlaas

yarn run aberlaas init
```

This will add `aberlaas` to your `devDependencies` and bootstrap your project.
Config files for all the tools will be created (`.eslintrc.js`,
`jest.config.js`, etc) and new `yarn run` scripts will be added for the most
common tasks (`lint`, `test`, `release`, etc).

At that point, you should probably commit all the changes.

### (Optional) Setup the external services

```shell
yarn run aberlaas setup
```

This will configure third party services like GitHub and CircleCI to work better
with `aberlaas`.

The following table lists all the scripts added:

| Script                     | Description                                               |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn run test`            | Run tests using Jest                                      |
| `yarn run test:watch`      | Run tests using Jest in watch mode                        |
| `yarn run ci`              | Run testing and linting in CI                             |
| `yarn run release`         | Release the module on npm                                 |

## Testing (with Jest)

`aberlaas test` to run all the Jest tests in `./lib`. You can alter the behavior
with the following options:

| CLI Argument | Default value    | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `[...]`      | `./lib`          | Files and directories to test.                               |
| `--config`   | `jest.config.js` | Jest config file to use                                      |
| `--watch`    | `false`          | If enabled, will listen for changes on files and rerun tests |
| `--failFast` | `false`          | If enabled, will stop as soon as one test fails              |

Note that you can also pass any other command-line flag and they will be passed
directly to Jest under the hood.

Jest is loaded with [jest-extended][1] allowing you to use new matchers like
`.toBeString()`, `.toStartWith()`, etc.

### New global variables

`testName` is available in all tests and contains the name of the current
`it`/`test` block.

`captureOutput` allows to swallow any `stdout`/`stderr` output for later
inspection. Output is stripped of any trailing newlines and ANSI characters.

```javascript
const actual = await captureOutput(async () => {
  console.log('foo');
});
// actual.stdout = ['foo']
```

[dedent][3] is included in all tests, so you can
write multiline strings without having to break your indentation.

```javascript
describe('moduleName', () => {
  describe('methodName', () => {
    it('should test a multiline string', () => {
      const input = dedent`
        Leading and trailing lines will be trimmed, so you can write something like
        this and have it work as you expect:

          * how convenient it is
          * that I can use an indented list
             - and still have it do the right thing`;
      // â€¦
    });
  });
```

## Precommit hooks

`aberlaas` uses `lint-staged` to make sure all committed code
follows your coding standard.

All `css`, `js`, `json` and `yml` files will be checked for parsing errors
(using `aberlaas lint` internally), and if errors are found it will attempt to
automatically fix them. If errors persist, it will prevent the commit and let
you know which file contains errors so you can fix them before committing again.

Whenever you commit a `.js` file that has a test attached (or a test file
directly), `aberlaas test` will be run on those files. If the tests don't pass,
your commit will be rejected.

Those two measures ensure that you'll never "break the build", by committing
invalid files or code that does not pass the test. If you want to ignore this
behavior, you can always add the `-n` option to your `git commit` command to
skip the hooks.

## Releasing

`aberlaas release` will release the package to npm. It will update
the version in `package.json` as well as creating the related git tag.

When called without arguments, it will prompt you for the next version to
package. If called with an argument, this will be used as the next version
number (for example, `yarn run release 1.1.3`). You can also use SemVer
increments (for example, `yarn run release minor`).

Use `--dry-run` to start a dry-run. It will simulate a release but won't
actually push anything to GitHub or npm.

## Continuous Integration

`aberlaas ci` is triggered by CI Servers (currently only CircleCI is supported),
and won't do anything when run locally.

When on a CI server it will first display the current node and yarn version, and
then `test` and `lint` scripts in that order. It will fail whenever one of them
fails, or succeed if they all succeed.

The node and yarn version used both locally and on the CI server will be the
same. A `.nvmrc` file is created when running `yarn run aberlaas init` that will
force local users to use the specified version. The same version is also
specified in the Docker image pulled by CircleCI. As for Yarn, a local copy of
the whole yarn program is added to the repository when first initializing it, so
both locals and CI servers will use it.

By default, tests running on the CI will be parallelized on two CPUs (this is
what most free CI tier offer). If you have access to higher end machines, you
can update this value by passing the `--cpu-count=X` flag to your `aberlaas ci`
call.

### Auto-Releasing

As an optional feature, you can have aberlaas automatically release a new
version of your module from the CI environment when relevant.

The CI will then check all the commits since the last release. If any commit is
a `feat()` it will release a new minor version; it any commit is a `fix()` it
will release a new patch version. For major release, you'll have to do it
manually.

This option is not enabled by default. If you need it, you need to follow those
steps:

- Run `aberlaas setup --auto-release`. It will setup the required `ENV` variables
  and ssh keys
- Update your `aberlaas ci` script to `aberlaas ci --auto-release`
- Uncomment the `add_ssh_keys` in your `.circleci.yml` file

## File structure

`./lib/configs` contain the default configuration for all the tools. They are
exported by the package and thus can be `require`d in userland.

`./templates` contains default configurations files copied to userland. Each
extends the configuration exported in the previous files. Copying files to
userland allows user to change the files if they want to change the behavior.

`.eslintrc.js`, `stylelint.config.js` and `vite.config.js` are local
configuration files for `aberlaas` itself. They eat their own dog food by
referencing the same configs as above.

## Tools used and their future

### ESLint

ESLint doesn't yet support ESM config files. We'll upgrade to the latest ESLint
when it does. This should also help fix the issue with Yarn PnP (see below).

### Yarn

**tl;dr; We'll move to Yarn PnP once ESLint has support for Flat Configs, and
default `yarn run` doesn't add a ~1s delay overhead**

#### PnP


Aberlaas is using Yarn Berry (v2+) as its main package management tool.

Yarn Berry comes with a Plug And Play (PnP) feature that replaces the usage of
`node_modules` in favor of a `.pnp.cjs` file. Instead of having a very large
`node_modules` folder, a unique copy of each dependency is stored in the user
home folder and the `.pnp.cjs` file only keeps references to those folder. This
makes installing dependencies faster as it needs way less I/O.

By ditching the whole `node_modules` principle, it also removes concepts like
hoisting of dependencies in a monorepo. This, unfortunately, breaks ESLint.

ESLint expect all its plugins to be defined as `peerDependencies` at the root of
a mono-repo, as it will always try to include them from there. It works more or
less correctly at the best of times, and `aberlaas` already has some hacks
(including `resolvePluginsRelativeTo`) to work around that.

But with PnP, there is no way to make it work correctly, so I will need to wait
for a better compatibility between ESLint and Yarn 2 before using it.

#### Calling binaries from the host

In yarn v1, if you install `aberlaas` in your project, all of `aberlaas`
dependencies (including binaries) were hoisted to the root. This was a design
flaw, as if several dependencies defined binaries by the same name, they would
fight in a race condition to take the slot in `node_modules/.bin`.

This has been fixed in Yarn Berry, but it also means it's no longer possible to
call `yarn run eslint` from a repository that includes `aberlaas`, because
`eslint` is not a direct dependency of the repo.

It might be possible to define proxy binaries inside of `aberlaas`, but those
will incur performance issues as they will need to spawn one more yarn context
(see below).

#### Calling binaries from aberlaas

In Yarn V1, I was calling binaries that `aberlaas` depends on (`eslint`, `vitest`,
etc) by calling `yarn run`. This was adding some overhead but was acceptable.
Yarn Berry adds even more overhead and it is becoming noticeable.

Now, my prefered way it to use the NodeJS API of the dependencies instead of
their CLI, to limit the overhead. I managed to move most tools to this new
approach, but sometimes I still need to use the CLI (`vitest` for example has
awesome live watching and display reloading that I don't think I can easily
replicate through code).

I ran some performance tests to see what would be the fastest way to call
`vitest` from `aberlaas`

```
hyperfine \
    "zsh -i -c 'yarn bin vitest && /home/tim/local/www/projects/aberlaas/node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs --version'" \
    "zsh -i -c 'yarn run vitest --version'" \
    "/home/tim/local/www/projects/aberlaas/node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs --version" \
    "/home/tim/local/www/projects/aberlaas/node_modules/.bin/vitest --version" 
Benchmark 1: zsh -i -c 'yarn run vitest --version'
  Time (mean Â± Ïƒ):      1.945 s Â±  0.051 s    [User: 1.986 s, System: 0.850 s]

Benchmark 2: zsh -i -c 'yarn bin vitest && /home/tim/local/www/projects/aberlaas/node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs --version'
  Time (mean Â± Ïƒ):      2.108 s Â±  0.150 s    [User: 2.108 s, System: 0.843 s]
  Range (min â€¦ max):    1.930 s â€¦  2.289 s    10 runs
 
Benchmark 3: /home/tim/local/www/projects/aberlaas/node_modules/vitest/vitest.m

  Range (min â€¦ max):   442.1 ms â€¦ 553.3 ms    10 runs
 
Benchmark 4: /home/tim/local/www/projects/aberlaas/node_modules/.bin/vitest --version
  Time (mean Â± Ïƒ):     491.9 ms Â±  29.6 ms    [User: 454.1 ms, System: 331.2 ms]
  Range (min â€¦ max):   453.8 ms â€¦ 535.4 ms    10 runs
```

Finding the binary through `yarn bin` then calling it is the slowest, but `yarn
run` isn't much faster. Directly calling the binary is the fastest, but it's
path can't be easily guessed (apart from reading and parsing a `package.json`).
But using the symlinks in `node_modules/.bin` is consistent, barely slower than
calling the binary directly and much faster than using yarn.

This is what I'll be using. Of course, this will break when I'll move to PnP as
the `node_modules` folder won't be there, but hopefully Yarn will be faster by
then and I can use `yarn run` reliably.

#### Speed

With Yarn 2+, calling `yarn run` seem to add ~1s of overhead each time. This is
a known issue (due to the fact Yarn 2 needs to spawn yarn 1, node and a few
other layers). 

1s is not much in itself, but grows quickly when you have nested `yarn run
aberlaas` calls that call `yarn run eslint`, and even more when you need to deal
with monorepos and multiple packages that each have their own yarn scope.

There are open issues on the topic, but nothing merged yet:

- [#3732](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/3732), where it is discussed to make yarn run aware that it's running yarn run
  and keep the same state without spawning new yarns
- [#2575](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/issues/2575), which is the main issue about Yarn performance, with benchmarks against
  npm/npx/yarn v1.

## Where does the name Aberlaas come from?

Aberlaas is the base camp from which all great expedition start in the _La Horde
du Contrevent_ book. I felt it's a great name for a bootstrapping kit for
modules.

For your convenience, `aberlass` and `aberlas` are added as aliases by default.
