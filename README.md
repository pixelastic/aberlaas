# Aberlaas

Shared default config for npm packages.

This include dependencies and sane configuration for the following tools:

- Babel
  - Presets and plugins
  - `.babelrc.js` configuration file
  - `babel-node` executable to run scripts
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Jest
- Husky

## Scripts

Aberlaas come with a command-line tool to execute the most used commands.

### `aberlaas release`

This will release the package to npm

### `aberlaas test` and `aberlaas test --watch`

### `aberlaas lint`

### `aberlaas build` and `aberlaas build --watch`

## Name

Aberlaas is the base camp from which all great expedition start in the _La Horde
du Contrevent_ book. I felt it was a great name for a bootstrapping kit for
modules.
